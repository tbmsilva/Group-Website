    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <h2>Bad Design</h2>
            <div class="imgBx">

            </div>
            
            <p>The design I encontered that represents a bad design are cars as the one in the image above, Teslas. This being because the 
            door handle in these cars is quite unusual and therefore not obvious for normal car users. As it shows in the image above,
            the handle looks like part of the car and it's supposed to be pushed, while in regular cars it's usually pulled.
            With this design I assume most people will be confused while confronted this door for the first time, making it a bad design for the door handle.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <h2>Good Design</h2>
            <div class="imgBx">
                <img src="range rover.jpg" alt="" width="90%"/>
            </div>

            <p>In the design of the car above, a Range Rover, as in most cars, the door handle is proper to be pulled. With this regular
            design people won't be confused about how to open the car door or have to read the manual to understand this very simple task.
            Having this in mind I consider this kind of door handle a good design, making the users life easy.</p>
